# DSGE-Examples-Using-Julia
In this project, we employ Julia to solve a spectrum of economic models, ranging from household optimization under income uncertainty to the intricate challenges posed by Riccati Matrix Equations and Linear Quadratic Dynamic Programming (LQ DP). We explore consumption-saving models with uniform shocks and apply both value function iteration and policy function iteration methods to extract optimal solutions. Through these endeavors, we illustrate Julia's exceptional numerical and computational capabilities, shedding light on the evolution of economic decisions in response to parameter variations, while also showcasing its versatility in addressing complex mathematical problems intrinsic to economic modeling. This project underscores the profound impact of computational methods in understanding economic dynamics and contributes to the ongoing discourse in economic analysis and optimization, positioning Julia as a valuable tool for researchers and economists.
